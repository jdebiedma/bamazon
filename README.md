# Bamazon

This is me creating my first Markdown file. I will be submitting this to **Bootcampspot** and most likely creating an app in *Heroku* (italics because it's fun). 

If it comes out well I will include this in my [coding portfolio.](https://floating-thicket-78326.herokuapp.com/portfolio.html)

The program incorporates the [mysql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql), [prompt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prompt), [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), and [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) packages.

## Using Bamazon

The Bamazon node app has three separate JavaScript files which run different functions.

### Customer Function

You can use Bamazon from a customer side by typing this into the bash console:

`node  bamazonCustomer.js`
